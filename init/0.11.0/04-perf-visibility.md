title: Perf: Symbol binding and visibility
kind: performance
---
Part of {{app}}'s new-system tickets (Kairo `docs/new-system.md`, `init/`). Write findings, decisions and results into this description, not into comments.

**Kind:** Performance. Assess it for {{app}}'s core; change the code only where it applies and gains.

## Applies when

Always assessed. Whether the change is made is the assessment's result.

## Technique

In a shared library, every function and global with default visibility can be interposed, so internal calls go through the PLT and globals through the GOT. Binding internal symbols locally (hidden visibility, or `-Wl,-Bsymbolic`) removes that indirection on hot paths.

## Assess

- Whether the technique applies to {{app}}'s core, and whether the core already has it.
- The gain on the RG DS, measured with `game_profile` and the frame host's reports (frames a second against the guest's, run time per frame, late frames, audio underruns), on the same games and setup before and after.
- That the guest runs exactly as before: `game_profile ... check exact` hashes every picture and all sound of both builds.

## Closing

- **Done:** the change is in, the guest runs exactly as before (`game_profile ... check exact`), and the gain is measured on the RG DS. Write the numbers into this description, then close as completed.
- **Not done** (it does not apply to this core, the core already has it, it gains nothing measurable, or it is not taken up now): write what was found into this description, add the `deferred` label, and leave the ticket open.

## Examples (for reference)

From other Kairo apps, for reference only. {{app}}'s core and machine may need it done differently.

- `shared/cmake/KairoMachine.cmake` hides the core's symbols.
