title: PC test: the machine runs flat out while loading, and only then
kind: validation
---
Part of {{app}}'s new-system tickets (Kairo `docs/new-system.md`, `init/`). Write findings, decisions and results into this description, not into comments.

**Kind:** Validation. Check it; build nothing unless the check fails.

## Applies when

Every new system ({{ref:flat-out-loads}}).

## Check

The shared check `loading` (Kairo#120): `loading()` turns on as a game reads its media, is off for good after the load, and never on in an idle launch. The check is written once, in the shared PC boot test ({{ref:boot-test}}); this ticket writes no test of its own. It gives {{app}}'s entries in `core/test/boot-tests.json` and makes them pass:

- A game that loads from the test media, and an idle case (a prompt or desktop with the drives empty).

## Passes when

- {{app}}'s entries pass, and breaking {{app}}'s side of what the check looks at fails them.

## Closing

- **Passes:** write the entries (commits) and what the check reported into this description, then close as completed.
- **Does not apply:** write why into this description, then close as not planned.
- **Fails:** file each failure as its own ticket (one problem each), list them here, and close this one when they are closed and the entries pass.
